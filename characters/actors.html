<h2> Characters </h2>

<h3> Sherlock Holmes </h3>
<img class="centerMe"  src="../images/cumberbatch.jpg" alt=" A Picture of Sherlock Holmes."/>
<p>Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) describes himself initially as "a consulting detective, the only one in the world," helping out Scotland Yard when they are out of their depth with cases (usually homicides). 
 He appears as a tall, thin man with dark, curly hair. Like the original character, Sherlock is able to deduce or abduce information from the small details</p>

<h3> John Watson </h3>

<p>John Hamish Watson (Martin Freeman) is Sherlock's colleague and former flatmate. He is often a foil to Sherlock in both appearance and personality. Unlike Sherlock, John is short with blond hair. He is kind, caring,
 compassionate and 'human' compared to Sherlock's cold, calculating hard-hearted ways. He gets on better with the police and takes care of practical matters at their flat,
 apparently doing most of the shopping. Sherlock has called him "the wisest, warmest human being [he] knows"</p>
 
<h3> Molly Hooper </h3>

<p>Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey) is a 31-year-old pathologist working in the morgue at St Bartholomew's Hospital with an apparent crush on Sherlock.
 Due to her work position and crush on him, Sherlock frequently exploits her to let him examine or perform experiments on victims' bodies, such as, as in Sherlock's first 
 scene in A Study in Pink, beating them with a riding crop in order to study postmortem bruising. She was in a relationship with an Information technology employee named Jim, 
 who was later revealed to be Moriarty. Molly maintained a blog, which she abandoned after discovering the truth about Jim.[citation needed] She has a cat named Toby. Sherlock 
 only finds out how deeply infatuated she is with him during "A Scandal in Belgravia," when he vehemently deduces that the Christmas present at the top of her bag is better wrapped
 than the others, and must be for someone she loves, and then discovers it's for him; she received a very uncharacteristic
 kiss on the cheek and apology for this. In "The Reichenbach Fall," Sherlock turns to her to help him fake his death.</p>
 
<h3> James Moriarty </h3>
<img class="centerMe" src="../images/moriarty.jpg" alt=" A picture of James Moriarty."/>
<p>James 'Jim' Moriarty (Andrew Scott) is the only "consulting criminal" in the world, a counterpoint to Sherlock's similarly unrivalled "consulting detective" 
and the primary antagonist of Series 1 & 2. He is also responsible for the criminals and crimes in all three episodes of the first series, acting as a sponsor,
 an informant, or a mastermind. His interest in Sherlock borders on obsession, though he does not hesitate trying to kill him when he loses interest. Like Sherlock,
 he appears to be motivated by boredom rather than money or power.
He is also an excellent actor, frequently shown to have convinced others that he is someone else â€“ indeed his first appearance occurs as a gay man whom Molly is seeing,
 and Sherlock does not realise his identity at the time. In "The Great Game", Moriarty forces Sherlock to solve mysteries within a time limit, taking hostages to ensure that 
 Sherlock is sufficiently motivated.</p>
